# Smart pip magic
A alternative pip magic to jupyter's %pip. It shows if you need to restart python after %pip install based on if existing imported modules are affected. 

## Install
```
pip install smart-pip-magic
```
## Usage
Enable smart pip:
```
import smart_pip
%pip install [opts] [list of package specifications]
```

**At the end of pip standard output, it will alert you if need to restart python and list all affected imported modules.**


Add action hook to act on affected imported modules by the end of %pip install. If no such module is found, hooks are not invoked. 

```
import smart_pip
def hook(modules_whose_files_changed: Callable[[List[str]], None]) -> None:
    print('hook called on ' + str(modules_whose_files_changed))
smart_pip.add_reload_hook(hook)
```

## Testing
```
pip install .[dev]
pytest
```
